## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I realized that my main weakness is not technical skill alone, but a lack of sustained passion in programming, despite development being a highly in-demand role.
- Procrastination has negatively affected my performance in many aspects of my work, and I am actively working to improve this habit.
- I need to improve my discipline and consistency when working on development tasks.
